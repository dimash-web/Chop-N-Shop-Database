# Ethical considerations of web scraping wihtin this project

## Purpose of data collection
The purpose of this scraper is to provide users (licensed battery treatment centres) with a curated list of end-of-life li-ion battery collection points. The data is used for educational purposes, specifically to explore web scraping techniques, and to offer users random movie suggestions from a reputable movie rating platform. 

## Data sources and robots.txt
Having studied the robots.txt guidelines of the scraped websites, I ensured that no restricted sections of the website are scraped. Only publicly accessible data is collected.

## Data usage

The data collected is used solely for educational purposes to demonstrate web scraping techniques and for research on movie recommendations. It will not be used for any commercial purposes, ensuring that all research complies with ethical standards and the honor code of NYU.
