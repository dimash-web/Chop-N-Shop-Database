# Ethical considerations of web scraping and API usage wihtin this project

## Purpose overview
The purpose of this project is to scrape the 2025 F1 race schedule from the official Formula 1 website and use the OpenWeatherMap API to pull weather data for each race location and date. The output is a CSV file containing the race location, date, and weather data. The data is used for educational purposes, specifically to explore web scraping techniques, and to offer users random movie suggestions from a reputable movie rating platform. 

## Data sources and robots.txt
Having studied the robots.txt guidelines of the official F1 website, I ensured that no restricted sections of the website are scraped.


## Collection practices
To minimize the load on the F1 website, the scraper operates at a controlled rate.
